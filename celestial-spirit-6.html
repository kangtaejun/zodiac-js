        <h2>Capricorn</h2>
        <h3>December 22 - January 19</h3>
        <p>The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn is represented by the sea goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and tail of a fish. Accordingly, Capricorns are skilled at navigating both the material and emotional realms. They scale the steepest mountains — Capricorn rules the knees, making it easier for this sign to climb — while simultaneously exploring their psychic strengths. Capricorns tap into their inner fortitude to overcome whatever stands between them and their long-term goals, and they don’t let anything distract them from getting ahead. Because of their unwavering focus, however, they are often perceived as cold and unemotional. Sea goats must remember that not every success in life can be featured on a résumé and that compassion is as important as any professional advancement.</p>
        <p>Capricorn is ruled by taskmaster Saturn, the stoic planet that governs time and restrictions. Saturn's transits always teach us tough lessons, but Capricorn is no stranger to growing pains. With Saturn guiding the Capricorn constellation, many sea goats were exposed to difficulties at an early age. Interestingly, Capricorns are said to age backward: Having already endured hardships, Capricorns become increasingly youthful, optimistic, and playful as they mature. Indeed, inside every earnest Capricorn is a mischievous troublemaker (in tarot, Capricorn is symbolized by the "devil" card). Though this earth sign may seem a bit conservative and restrained at first, Capricorn’s closest friends and lovers know that these sea goats love to party.</p>
        <p>A cardinal sign, Capricorn is excellent at taking action and launching initiatives. Capricorn’s can-do attitude leads to success in pretty much any industry. While they're terrific leaders, they must also be mindful about their workaholic tendencies. It’s important for Capricorn to maintain a healthy work-life balance and avoid treating their friends and partners like their assistants. Resist the temptation to ask your partner to proofread that work email tonight, Cap, and connect with them on something other than what happened at the office.</p>
