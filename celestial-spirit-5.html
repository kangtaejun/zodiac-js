        <h2>Sagittarius</h2>
        <h3>November 22 - December 21</h3>
        <p>Represented by the archer, Sagittarians are always on a quest for knowledge. The last fire sign of the zodiac, Sagittarius launches its many pursuits like blazing arrows, chasing after geographical, intellectual, and spiritual adventures. Fueled by wanderlust, these archers can be found traversing all corners of the world on thrill-seeking expeditions.</p>
        <p>It's no surprise that Jupiter, the planet of abundance, spirituality, and growth, governs Sagittarius. With so many journeys under their belt, Sagittarians are excellent storytellers and can light up any room with their exhilarating tales and infectious laughter. Effortlessly magnetic, Sags easily attract friends and lovers with their senses of humor. They're the comedians of the zodiac and infuse all of their conversations with wit and "no bullshit" bluntness. While their bon mots are unmatched, Sags must remember to keep their sharp tongues in check. Though they know a lot, they don’t know everything — and if they're not careful, they can come off as pretentious or arrogant.</p>
        <p>Sagittarius is a mutable sign, meaning it is associated with adaptability and flexibility. This perfectly reflects the archers’ deep-rooted desire for change. Sagittarians are born to explore, and it is critical that these archers have the freedom to roam. (Sagittarius rules the thighs, so these archers are always on the move.) Romantically, Sagittarians seek a copilot: These adventurous lovers resent any boundaries, so constant motion is essential in any Sag relationship. If you are lucky enough to link up with one of these archers, be sure to buckle up and have your passport ready. With Sagittarius, it’s always a wild ride.</p>
