        <h2>Scorpio</h2>
        <h3>October 23 - November 21</h3>
        <p>Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion and power, Scorpio is often mistaken for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that derives its strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like its fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive.</p>
        <p>What makes this water sign unique is its distinctive venomous sting. Like their celestial spirit animal, the scorpion, Scorpios lie in wait and strike when least expected. Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, who are constantly plotting several steps ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are necessarily nefarious. Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game to get it. They never show their cards, and their enigmatic nature is what makes them so seductive and beguiling. Scorpio is the sign most closely associated with sex: The part of the body that Scorpio governs is the genital area. Sex isn't about solely about pleasure for these sensual scorpions, either: They also crave the physical closeness, spiritual illumination, and emotional intimacy that sex can provide.</p>
        <p>Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, the planet that governs both destruction and transformation. On a good day, Scorpionic energy is ambitious and enticing. On a bad day, however, the shadowy side of Scorpio is fueled by a relentless desire for control. Power-hungry Scorpios must remember that, if controlled by their egos, they are at risk of poisoning themselves. This sign is at its best when its intrinsic intensity is applied to deep, soulful connections with friends and lovers. When they build trust with others, Scorpios demonstrate unparalleled empathy, depth, and commitment which brighten even the darkest parts of Scorpioâ€™s magical psyche.</p>
