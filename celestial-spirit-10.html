        <h2>Taurus</h2>
        <h3>April 20 - May 20</h3>
        <p>Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent flavors. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the enchanting planet that governs love, beauty, and money. Taurus’s Venusian influence make this earth sign the most sensual of the zodiac: These cosmic oxen are enchanted by any physical manifestation of comfort and luxury. Pleasure is a necessity for epicurean Taureans, and they feel most content when pampered. (Taurus governs the neck, so neck caresses are especially irresistible to these bulls.)</p>
        <p>It's true that in their perfect world, Taureans would spend all day bathing in a tub overflowing with essential oils. At the same time, these earth signs know the value of a dollar. Taureans aren’t afraid to roll up their sleeves and work hard to earn big rewards. These earth signs are ambitious, focused, and resilient, and they feel most secure when steadily putting money away into a savings account. Cosmic oxen are all about return on investment (the bull is also the symbol of Wall Street), and Taureans know how to play the long game in both professional and romantic pursuits. Security is paramount for Taureans, and any threat to their stability will be sure to have a celestial bull seeing red.</p>
        <p>As a sign, Taurus is fixed, an astrological quality that reflects Taurus’s steadfast, loyal nature. Fixed signs are excellent at maintaining systems, and Taureans prioritize consistency and reliability in all areas of their lives. It must be noted, however, that Taurus does have a bit of a reputation: What a Taurus perceives as dedication is often regarded by others as stubbornness. Accordingly, these bulls may end up lingering in unhealthy situations — whether relationships, jobs, or homes — longer than necessary just to prove a point. Despite their occasional obstinance, however, Taureans are dependable partners, soothing their friends and lovers through their trustworthiness and devotion.</p>
