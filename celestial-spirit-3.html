        <h2>Libra</h2>
        <h3>September 23 - October 22</h3>
        <p>Libra is an air sign represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an association that reflects Libra's fixation on balance and harmony. Libra is obsessed with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life. These air signs are the aesthetes of the zodiac: Ruled by Venus, the planet that governs love, beauty, and money, Libras adore high art, intellectualism, and connoisseurship. Suave Libras need to surround themselves with stunning objects and create environments that reflect their exquisite tastes. Accordingly, these air signs make excellent designers, decorators, art critics, and stylists.</p>
        <p>While Libra's opposite sign, Aries, represents “me,” Libra symbolizes “we.” Relationships are paramount for Libras, who find balance in companionship. They love harmonious partnerships with fashionable mates, especially those who make attractive arm candy. (Libra governs the skin, and these air signs are highly motivated by physical appearances. There's no way Libra would rather relax than with a luxurious face mask.) Libras are regularly coupled, and when they are, they must be careful about seeking attention outside the agreed-upon boundaries of their relationships. Since they try to keep everyone happy and engaged, they may find themselves tempted to push the limits of their agreements with their partners. People-pleasing Libras must remember that the happiness of their loved ones and the health of their relationships is more important than maintaining the attention of distant admirers.</p>
        <p>Libra is a cardinal sign, which means Libras are accordingly great at launching new initiatives. Because Libras consider multiple perspectives in all pursuits, however, these air signs struggle with indecision. Instead of constantly seeking outside perspectives, Libras would do well to develop (and trust) their own intuition. Their characteristic ambivalence aside, Libras can navigate virtually any social situation, effortlessly resolving conflicts by simply turning on the charm.</p>
